# IslandMan.Elmish.Router
Simple, but very useful router that's only using Fable and Elmish. Full path url's are supported

# Rationale
I needed a router for use in SAFE stack, but the one's I found where general purpose routers supporting routing types that I don't need (and aren't recommended any longer either). I also didn't want Fable.React to play any part in the router, keeping it as close to native js as I could.
